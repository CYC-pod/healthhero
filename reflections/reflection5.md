## Reflection Questions

How was the pacing of the capstone project? (i.e too slow, just right, too fast)


Do you feel the labs and weekly assignments prepare you to create a capstone project? Be specific, what topics do you still have questions about that may or may not have been covered?


When planning for the capstone project, which resources were the most helpful? (i.e mentors, instructors & TAs, ideation process, pod syncs, wireframes, sprint planning, bug bash, practice demo day, etc.)
